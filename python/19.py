"""
A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. 
He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, 
return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
