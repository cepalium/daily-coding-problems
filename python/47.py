"""
Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, 
write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. 
You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, 
since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

    # output: max profit from buying first and selling that stock later

    for i in range(len(stocks) - 1):
        buy = stocks[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, len(stocks)):
            sell = stocks[j]
            if sell - buy > maxProfit:  # update maxProfit
